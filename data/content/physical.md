The nervous system is like your body's electrical grid—fast, intricate, and essential for everything from reflexes to deep thoughts. Here's a clear breakdown of its structure 🧠⚡:

---

### 🧠 1. Central Nervous System (CNS)
This is the command center.

- **Brain**: Controls thoughts, emotions, memory, and voluntary movements.
- **Spinal Cord**: Transmits signals between the brain and the body; also handles reflexes.

---

### 🌐 2. Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)
This is the communication network that links the CNS to the rest of the body.

- **Cranial Nerves**: Connect the brain to parts of the head and neck.
- **Spinal Nerves**: Branch from the spinal cord to limbs and organs.

### ⚙️ 3. Functional Divisions of the PNS

| Division               | Function                                      | Example                          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Somatic Nervous System** | Controls voluntary movements and sensory input | Moving your arm, feeling heat   |
| **Autonomic Nervous System** | Regulates involuntary functions             | Heart rate, digestion, sweating |

The autonomic system is further split into:
- **Sympathetic**: Activates "fight or flight" responses
- **Parasympathetic**: Promotes "rest and digest" functions
- **Enteric**: Manages digestion independently

### 🔌 4. Neurons: The Wiring
- **Sensory Neurons**: Carry signals from body to brain (e.g., pain, temperature)
- **Motor Neurons**: Carry commands from brain to muscles
- **Interneurons**: Connect neurons within the CNS for processing

---

### 🧬 5. Supporting Cells (Glia)
- **Astrocytes**: Maintain the environment around neurons
- **Oligodendrocytes & Schwann Cells**: Create myelin for faster signal transmission
- **Microglia**: Act as immune defenders in the brain

This entire system works together to help you move, think, feel, and survive. If you want to explore how meditation or stress affects these structures, I can show you how the nervous system adapts and rewires itself. Want to go there next?
