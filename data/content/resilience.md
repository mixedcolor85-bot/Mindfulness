Stress prevention and reduction, as well as emergency coping strategies, can help minimize personal daily deterioration.

🔹 Cognitive Strategies
1️⃣ Cognitive Approach
1. Emotion Labeling
    * “Right now I feel anger and anxiety.”
    * Effect: Activates prefrontal cortex → inhibits amygdala
2. Self-distancing
    * “This stimulus and my response are separate.”
    * Effect: Suppresses automatic aggressive or overreactive behaviors
3. Cognitive Reappraisal
    * “The environment cannot be changed, but my responses and choices are controllable.”
    * Effect: Reduces helplessness and resentment
4. Grounding / Attention Redirection
    * Check visual, auditory, tactile stimuli → focus on the present
    * Effect: Suppresses excessive imagination and repetitive stress thinking

2️⃣ Behavioral Strategies
1. Immediate Routine Actions
    * Drink water, close eyes, short stretches
    * Effect: Regains sense of control, stabilizes nervous system
2. Brief Physical Movements
    * Move around, shake hands/feet, light exercises
    * Effect: Relieves muscle tension, inhibits sympathetic nervous system
3. Sensory Stimulation
    * Cold water on face/hands/feet, massage → immediate calming
4. Maintain Regular Routines
    * Consistent meals, sleep, exercise → stabilize under repetitive environmental stress
5. Express Emotions
    * Writing, speaking, vocalizing → relieve suppressed anger and anxiety

3️⃣ Core Principles
* Do not try to change the environment → control only your own domain
* Immediate calming → focus on body, senses, breathing
* Cognitive distancing → suppress repetitive aggression/automatic reactions
* Maintain behavioral routines → enhance long-term resilience

💡 Summary:
“While the environment is uncontrollable, cognitive distancing + emotion labeling + behavioral routines can prevent stress explosions and minimize daily deterioration.”
